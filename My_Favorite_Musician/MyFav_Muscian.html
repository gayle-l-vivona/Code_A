    Daisy is one of the happiest dogs. She loves to retrieve. She'll find things you didn't even know were missing. She is trained for duck hunting, but will chase squirrels and geese if ducks are not available. She also loves to swim. She's only gone swimming in lakes and streams so far, but will be going to a doggie swimming pool next week.
